# overdetermined_system
Solving an overdetermined system of linear equations using two methods: normal equation and Householder reflection. Given data are approximated by Legendre polynomials
The program outputs table with following columns: condition number of matrices A and (A^T)A, mean squared error for both methods and amount of time in seconds they took
